      <h1>Best 3D printer of 2025?</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      Hello, and welcome to my first blog article. This is my personal opinion about the best 3D printer to start with in 2026.
      You may think the blog article and the title won't match the years, but this is actually a made-in 2025 or older 3D printer
      starting recommendation for what to choose in 2026.
    </p>

    <p>Anyways, let's go to the main thing. I personally recommend you the P2S Combo from Bambu Labs.</p>

    <p>
      It's just 799$ for it, and you can always buy new AMS systems for more colors. Speaking of colors, all the normal 3D printers
      mostly have 1 external spool holder meaning only 1 color is printable. But with the AMS, you could print 5 color.
      With up to 4 AMS 2 Pros that consist of four colors each and 8 AMS HTs that consist of one color each but a higher max drying
      temps. That means 16+8+1=25 colors max. That system is applicable for almost all Bambu Lab printers.
    </p>

    <p>
      A cheaper variant of it is the P1S/P1P. They are both P1(e)s but the P1S is a enclosed variant and the P1P is the open variant.
      They both have the same specs except for the P1P having some stuff like the LiDar sensor not included. They have a lower-end
      camera instead of the high-quality one on the P2S.
    </p>

    <p>
      The normal P1S is 399$, the normal AMS without drying included combo is 549$, and the one with the AMS 2 Pro is 639$.
      The P1P is not suitable for buying though due to it normally not selling and the P1S has more features for a better price.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if you still want a cheaper one, the A series is the way to go. They have lower acceleration speeds but they are still quite fast.
      A1 Combo being 399$ and the A1 mini Combo being 329$. The A1 mini has a build size of 180mm all sides, and the A1 has a build size
      of 256mm all sides and that is same for all Bambu Lab 3D printers EXCLUDING the H2 series made for industries. The A series are bed slingers
      meaning it uses more size for the bed movement.
    </p>

    <p>
      All Bambu Lab printers have a print speed of 500mm per second and 20000 mm per cubic second EXCLUDING the H2 series and the A series.
      The A series all have a 500mm per second which is same but only the thing that it has a 10000 mm per cubic second makes it different.
    </p>

    <p>
      I really want to feature out other brand's 3D printer like Prusa or Creality but I was tired to write that much, and no.
      This is not a sponsor from Bambu Lab or anything, it's just my opinion. And if you're asking me why I'm not adding the H2 series,
      look the image below.
